Project Title: API Data Parsing and Visualization

Description:

This project demonstrates the process of fetching JSON data from an API, parsing it, and presenting it in a user-friendly format. It leverages JavaScript's fetch API to retrieve product information and displays the data in a well-structured HTML table, sorted by popularity in descending order.

Key Functionalities:

Fetches JSON data from the provided API endpoint: https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json
Parses the JSON to extract product details (subcategory, title, price, popularity)
Stores the data in a JavaScript object
Sorts the products based on popularity (descending order)
Creates an HTML table to display the sorted product data
Technologies Used:

JavaScript (fetch API, DOM manipulation)
HTML
CSS (optional for styling the table)
Project Structure:

README.md (this file)
index.html (HTML structure and table)
index.js (JavaScript code for fetching, parsing, and displaying data)
style.css (optional CSS file for table styling)
Installation and Usage:

Clone the Repository:

 Run the Application Locally:

Open index.html in your web browser (or use a local server).
The table will be populated with the fetched and sorted product data.
Deployment:

This project can be easily deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages or Heroku. Refer to their respective documentation for specific instructions.
Further Enhancements:

Implement error handling for potential API fetching failures.
Add pagination to handle large datasets.
Include user interface elements (e.g., search bar, filters) for interactive data exploration.
Consider using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js for a more structured and maintainable codebase (optional).
License:

Consider adding a license file (e.g., MIT, Apache) to clarify how others can use and distribute your code.
